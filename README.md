# PA1450
### A virtual lab environment
***

## Quick Start

You're currently viewing the branch `virtual-lab-environment`. This branch contains documentation for setting up a virtual lab environment for Python development. The machine contains the tools necessary for developing Python 3.9 applications.

If you've been given a ready-to-use virtual machine image, you will not need this branch.

If you, however, intend to set up the virtual machine from scratch, you're in the right place. You may start by reading through the file called `virtual-machine-setup.md`.

The username and password for the machine is `pa1450`.
