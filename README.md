### Project for the course PA1450 - Software Development at BTH, Sweden
***

## Quick Start

You're currently viewing the branch `main`. This branch contains documentation for the rest of the repository's branches.

### Virtual Lab Environment

The branch `virtual-lab-environment` contains detailed instructions for setting up a virtual lab environment fit for the purpose of developing Python software.

### Skeleton

The branch `skeleton` contains a skeleton Python 3 application for use with a CLI. It features example commands and an example Flask application.

## Course set-up

_Taken from the internal course page._

The course is organized around several lectures / discussions to introduce the foundations and development models, project meetings and workshops to organise the two project planning, management and execution activities as well. The project planning, management and execution activities will consist in the requirements elicitation and documentation, planning and execution of a software project. This will be carried out twice, following a "traditional" software development model and an agile development process.

These project planning, management and execution activities have the purpose of letting the students try the theory studied as well as gaining some understanding regarding the adoption of the development models and techniques in practical contexts.

Finally, in the context of the second project planning, management and execution activity a small software development task will be carried out, in which the students, organised in groups of 3 or 4 members will develop a small piece of software to be integrated into a bigger software system.
